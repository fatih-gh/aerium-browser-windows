# Updating Aerium (Windows)

How to move Aerium onto a newer Chromium release when the **Upstream
watch** workflow opens a tracking issue.

## Where things live

- **Base**: `ungoogled-chromium` submodule + this repo's Windows
  packaging (fork of `ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium-windows`).
  Chromium version is in `ungoogled-chromium/chromium_version.txt`.
- **Our changes**: `_apply_branding` in `build.py` (Chromium→Aerium,
  Dioide, logo swap), `patches/ungoogled-fatih/` (default-flags,
  bundled-external-extensions, aerium-theme), `brand/` (logo assets),
  the staged workflow under `.github/`.

## Sync procedure

Upstream (ungoogled-software) uses normal PRs, so a merge is safe here.

1. `git remote add upstream https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium-windows.git` (once)
2. `git fetch upstream && git merge upstream/master`
3. Resolve conflicts. Our files most likely to conflict: `build.py`
   (keep `_apply_branding` and the extension staging), `package.py`
   (keep `aerium_*` names + Extensions include), `.github/workflows/`
   (ours is a distinct staged pipeline — usually keep ours).
4. Bump the submodule if the merge didn't:
   `git -C ungoogled-chromium fetch --tags && git -C ungoogled-chromium checkout <tag>`.
5. Verify our three patches still apply against the new Chromium:
   ```
   # in a scratch checkout of the new chromium source
   patch -p1 --dry-run < patches/ungoogled-fatih/default-flags.patch
   patch -p1 --dry-run < patches/ungoogled-fatih/bundled-external-extensions.patch
   patch -p1 --dry-run < patches/ungoogled-fatih/aerium-theme.patch
   ```
6. Commit and dispatch **build-x64**.

## When a patch fails to apply

Our three patches target specific Chromium files that occasionally move:

- `default-flags.patch` → `components/webui/flags/pref_service_flags_storage.cc`
- `bundled-external-extensions.patch` → `chrome/browser/extensions/external_provider_impl.cc`
- `aerium-theme.patch` → `chrome/browser/themes/theme_service.cc`

If `--dry-run` reports a hunk failure, open the target file at the new
Chromium tag on
`https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/refs/tags/<version>/<path>`,
find the moved code, and regenerate the patch against it. The
`_apply_branding` string sweep in `build.py` is version-tolerant (it
greps for "Chromium" across grd/grdp/xtb) and rarely needs changes.

## Chrome Web Store crx pin

`build.py` pins the bundled extension by version + sha256
(`_CWS_VERSION`, `_CWS_SHA256`). If NeverDecaf/chromium-web-store
releases a new version, update both or the download check will fail.
